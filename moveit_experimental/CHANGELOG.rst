0.10.0 (2018-05-22)
-------------------
* Merge pull request `#906 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/906>`_ from ubi-agni/compile-fixes
  various fixes for melodic build
* boost::shared_ptr to std::shared_ptr
* MoveIt! tf2 migration (`#830 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/830>`_)
  migration from tf to tf2 API, resolves issue `#745 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/745>`_
  - All type conversions now depend on geometry2 ROS packages, rather than geometry
  (see https://github.com/ros/geometry2/pull/292 and
  https://github.com/ros/geometry2/pull/294 for details of the new conversions)
  - Removes all boost::shared_ptr<tf::TransformListener> from the API,
  and replaced them with std::shared_ptr<tf2_ros::Buffer>'s
  - Utilize new tf2 API in the tf::Transformer library to access the internal tf2::Buffer of RViz
  (see https://github.com/ros/geometry/pull/163 for details of the new API)
  - Removes prepending of forward slashes ('/') for transforms frames as this is deprecated in tf2
  - Replaced deprecated tf2 _getLatestCommonTime
* update include statements to use new pluginlib and class_loader headers (`#827 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/827>`_)
* fix printf conversion specifiers for logging  (`#876 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/876>`_)
  * printf size_t values with %zu
* [Fix] switch to ROS_LOGGER from CONSOLE_BRIDGE (`#874 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/874>`_)
  * [Fix] switch to ROS_LOGGER from CONSOLE_BRIDGE
  * [Fix] clang format
  * [Fix] manually fix bad clang-formatting in strings
* Merge pull request `#863 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/863>`_ from ubi-agni/fix-buid-farm-issues
  * fix various cmake warnings
  * remove not required test dependency
  * replaced 2nd find_package(catkin ...)
* fix various cmake warnings
* Add ability to request detailed distance information from fcl (`#662 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/662>`_)
  Expose the ability to request detailed distance information from FCL. New virtual methods distanceXXX(DistanceRequest&, DistanceResult&) are provided in CollisionRobot and CollisionWorld. Existing methods were adapted to use the new underlying infrastructure of DistanceRequests.

------------------

0.9.0 (2016-10-19)
------------------
* Replace broken Eigen3 with correctly spelled EIGEN3 (`#254 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/254>`_)
  * Fix Eigen3 dependency throughout packages
  * Eigen 3.2 does not provide EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIRS, only EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR
* fix exported plugin xml for collision_distance_field (`#280 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/280>`_)
  Otherwise the xml can not be found on an installed workspace
* Cleanup readme (`#258 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/258>`_)
* Convert collision_distance_field to std::shared_ptr.
* Use shared_ptr typedefs in collision_distance_field and chomp.
* Use srdf::ModelPtr typedefs.
* Switch to std::make_shared.
* [moveit_experimental] Fix incorrect dependency on FCL in kinetic
  [moveit_experimental] Fix Eigen3 warning
* Remove deprecated package shape_tools
  Fix OcTree boost::shared_ptr
  Remove deprecated CMake dependency
  Fix distanceRobot() API with verbose flags
* Fix CHOMP planner and CollisionDistanceField (`#155 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/155>`_)
  * Copy collision_distance_field package
  * Resurrect chomp
  * remove some old Makefiles and manifests
  * Correct various errors
  * Code formatting, author, description, version, etc
  * Add definitions for c++11. Nested templates problem.
  * Add name to planner plugin.
  * Change getJointModels to getActiveJointModels.
  * Call robot_state::RobotState::update in setRobotStateFromPoint.
  * Create README.md
  * Improve package.xml, CMake config and other changes suggested by jrgnicho.
  * Remove some commented code, add scaling factors to computeTimeStampes
  * Add install targets in moveit_experimental and chomp
  * Add install target for headers in chomp pkgs.
  * Remove unnecessary debugging ROS_INFO.
  * Port collision_distance_field test to indigo.
  * Remove one assertion that makes collision_distance_field test to fail.
* Use urdf::*SharedPtr instead of boost::shared_ptr
  urdfdom_headers uses C++ std::shared_ptr. As it exports it as custom
  *SharedPtr type, we can use them to stay compatible.
  Note that there is no std:shared_ptr<const urdf::ModelInterface>
  typedef, so I replaced it with urdf::ModelInterfaceSharedPtr (loosing a
  const).
  Also, there is no conversion from boost::shared_ptr<urdf::Model> to
  std:shared_ptr<urdf::ModelInterface>, so I used a preprocessor
  directive.
* fetch moveit_resources path at compile time
  using variable MOVEIT_TEST_RESOURCES_DIR provided by config.h
  instead of calling ros::package::getPath()
* adapted paths to moveit_resources
  (renamed folder moveit_resources/test to moveit_resources/pr2_description)
