0.10.0 (2018-05-22)
-------------------
* Merge pull request `#906 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/906>`_ from ubi-agni/compile-fixes
  various fixes for melodic build
* KDL solvers: provide dummy updateInternalDataStructures()
  ... for new abstract method in KDL 1.4.0 of Melodic
* MoveIt! tf2 migration (`#830 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/830>`_)
  migration from tf to tf2 API, resolves issue `#745 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/745>`_
  - All type conversions now depend on geometry2 ROS packages, rather than geometry
  (see https://github.com/ros/geometry2/pull/292 and
  https://github.com/ros/geometry2/pull/294 for details of the new conversions)
  - Removes all boost::shared_ptr<tf::TransformListener> from the API,
  and replaced them with std::shared_ptr<tf2_ros::Buffer>'s
  - Utilize new tf2 API in the tf::Transformer library to access the internal tf2::Buffer of RViz
  (see https://github.com/ros/geometry/pull/163 for details of the new API)
  - Removes prepending of forward slashes ('/') for transforms frames as this is deprecated in tf2
  - Replaced deprecated tf2 _getLatestCommonTime
* update include statements to use new pluginlib and class_loader headers (`#827 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/827>`_)
* [Fix] switch to ROS_LOGGER from CONSOLE_BRIDGE (`#874 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/874>`_)
  * [Fix] switch to ROS_LOGGER from CONSOLE_BRIDGE
  * [Fix] clang format
  * [Fix] manually fix bad clang-formatting in strings
* Merge pull request `#863 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/863>`_ from ubi-agni/fix-buid-farm-issues
  * fix various cmake warnings
  * remove not required test dependency
  * replaced 2nd find_package(catkin ...)
* fix various cmake warnings
* Improve ikfast kinematics plugin (`#808 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/808>`_)
  * Initialize constant num_joints\_ in constructor.
  * Check size of input array in getPositionFK.
  * Fix implementation error.
  * Add name variable to ikfast plugin.
* Cached ik kinematics plugin (`#612 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/612>`_)
  add caching wrapper for IK solvers
  * - Remove OMPL dependency, add slightly modified versions of OMPL code to this repo
  - Change camelCase variable names to underscore_names
  - Use /** ... */ for doxygen comments instead of /// ...
  - Fix memory leak
  - Various small fixes
  * handle optional TRAC-IK dependency a different way
  * remove OMPL_INCLUDE_DIRS
  * include trac_ik headers optionally *after* moveit includes
  Sorting dependency-includes via catkin breaks either way around
  with multiple `find_package` calls and can always break
  overlaying workspaces.
  However, ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS} contains many more dependencies
  than ${trac_ik_kinematics_plugin_INCLUDE_DIRS}, so avoid more
  breakage than necessary by including catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS first.
  * add missing include
  * Don't write configured file to build dir. Can't write to src dir either since it might be read-only. Instead, just comment out the parts that are for development / testing purposes only.
  * ik cache: use lookupParam for plugin parameters
