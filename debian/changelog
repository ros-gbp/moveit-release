    an alternative location using the 'db_path' argument.

  * Debug and octomap improvements in launch file templates
  * Values are now read from kinematics.yaml correctly. Previously, keys such
    as "kinematics_solver" were not found.
  * Added clear octomap service to move_group launch file template
  * Added gdb debug helper that allows easier break point addition
  * Add launch file for joystick control of MotionPlanningPlugin
  * Joint limits comments
  * Removed velocity scaling factor
  * Added a new 'velocity_scaling_factor' parameter to evenly reduce max joint velocity for all joints. Added documentation.
  * Simply renamed kin_model to robot_model for more proper naming convension
  * Added new launch file for controll Rviz with joystick
  * use relative instead of absolute names for topics (to allow for namespaces)
  * Added planner specific parameters to ompl_planning.yaml emitter.
  * Added space after every , in function calls
    Added either a space or a c-return before opening {
    Moved & next to the variable in the member function declarations
  * Added planner specific parameters to ompl_planning.yaml emitter.
    Each parameter is set to current defaults. This is fragile, as defaults may change.
