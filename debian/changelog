  * factored out setCollisionLinkPairs into MoveItConfigData
  * require output path to be set if SRDF path is overwritten by a xacro file path
  * separated xacro parsing from loadFileToString
  * make disabled_collisions entries unique
  * Added command-line SRDF updater
  * Merge pull request from 130s/fix/windowsize
    Shrink window height

  * Merge pull request #103  from gavanderhoorn/issue102_cfgrble_db_path
    Fix for issue #102 : allow user to set mongodb db location

    Also update generated demo.launch accordingly.
    The default directory could be located on a non-writable file system, leading
    to crashes of the mongodb wrapper script. This change allows the user to specify
    an alternative location using the 'db_path' argument.
  * Update configuration_files_widget.cpp
    Fix link

  * Values are now read from kinematics.yaml correctly.
  * Simplified the inputKinematicsYAML() code.
  * Debug and octomap improvements in launch file templates
  * Values are now read from kinematics.yaml correctly. Previously, keys such
    as "kinematics_solver" were not found.
  * Added clear octomap service to move_group launch file template
  * Added gdb debug helper that allows easier break point addition
  * Add launch file for joystick control of MotionPlanningPlugin
  * Joint limits comments
  * Removed velocity scaling factor
  * Added a new 'velocity_scaling_factor' parameter to evenly reduce max joint velocity for all joints. Added documentation.
  * Simply renamed kin_model to robot_model for more proper naming convension
  * Added new launch file for controll Rviz with joystick
  * use relative instead of absolute names for topics (to allow for namespaces)
  * Added planner specific parameters to ompl_planning.yaml emitter.
  * Added space after every , in function calls
    Added either a space or a c-return before opening {
    Moved & next to the variable in the member function declarations
  * Added planner specific parameters to ompl_planning.yaml emitter.
    Each parameter is set to current defaults. This is fragile, as defaults may change.
