ros-noetic-moveit-core (1.1.6-1buster) buster; urgency=high

  * Silent warning about invalid ``virtual_joint`` in Gazebo setups
  * Add ``RobotState::getRigidlyConnectedParentLinkModel`` #2918 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2918> (add RobotState::getRigidlyAttachedParentLink)
  * Normalize incoming transforms (#2920 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2920>)
  * Reworked compiler flags and fixed various warnings (#2915 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2915>)
    
      * Remove unused arguments from global_adjustment_factor()
      * Simplify API: Remove obviously unused arguments
      * Introduced cmake macro ``moveit_build_options()`` in ``moveit_core`` to centrally define
        common build options like ``CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD``, ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE``, and compiler warning flags
    
  * Fix uninitialized orientation in default shape pose (#2896 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2896>)
  * Drop the minimum velocity/acceleration limits for TOTG (#2937 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2937>)
  * Readability and consistency improvements in TOTG (#2882 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2882>)
  * Bullet collision: Consider ACM defaults using ``getAllowedCollision()`` (#2871 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2871>)
  * ``PlanningScene::getPlanningSceneDiffMsg()``: Do not list an object as destroyed when it got attached (#2864 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2864>)The information in the diff is redundant because attaching implies the removal from the PlanningScene.
    In the unlikely case, you relied on the ``REMOVE`` entry in the diff message,
    use the newly attached collision object to indicate the same instead.
  * Fix Bullet collision: Register ``notify`` function to receive world updates (#2830 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2830>)
  * Split CollisionPluginLoader (#2834 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2834>)To avoid circular dependencies, but enable reuse of the ``CollisionPluginLoader``, the non-ROS part was moved into ``moveit_core/moveit_collision_detection.so``
    and the ROS part (reading the plugin name from the parameter server) into ``moveit_ros_planning/moveit_collision_plugin_loader.so`` (as before).
  * Use default copy constructor to clone attached objects (#2855 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2855>)
  * Fix pose-not-set-bug (#2852 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2852>)
  * Add API for passing a ``RNG`` to ``setToRandomPositionsNearBy()`` (#2799 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2799>)
  * Fix backwards compatibility for specifying poses for a single collision shape (#2816 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2816>)
  * Fix Bullet collision returning wrong contact type (#2829 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2829>)
  * Add ``RobotState::setToDefaultValues(string group)`` (#2828 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2828>)
  * Fix confusion of tolerance limits in JointConstraint (#2815 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2815>)
  * Fix RobotState constructor segfault (#2790 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2790>)
  * Preserve metadata (color, type) when detaching objects (#2814 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2814>)
  * Introduce a reference frame for collision objects (#2037 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2037>)``CollisionObject`` messages are now defined with a ``Pose``. Shapes and subframes are defined relative to that pose.
    This makes it easier to place objects with subframes and multiple shapes in the scene.
    This causes several changes:
    
      * ``getFrameTransform()`` now returns this pose instead of the first shape's pose.
      * The Rviz plugin's manipulation tab now uses the object's pose instead of the shape pose to evaluate if object's are in the region of interest.
      * PlanningScene geometry text files (``.scene``) have changed format.Add a line ``0 0 0 0 0 0 1`` under each line with an asterisk to upgrade old files if required.
    
  * Fix bullet plugin library path name (#2783 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2783>)
  * clang-tidy: modernize-make-shared, modernize-make-unique (#2762 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2762>)
  * ``RobotTrajectory``: convenience constructor + chain setter support (#2751 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2751>)
  * Fix Windows build (#2604 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2604>, #2776 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2776>)
  * Allow axis-angle representation for orientation constraints (#2402 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2402>)
  * Optimization: ``reserve()`` vector in advance (#2732 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2732>)
  * Use same padding/scale for attached collision objects as for parent link (#2721 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2721>)
  * Optimize ``FCL distanceCallback()``: use thread_local vars, avoid copying (#2698 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2698>)
  * Remove octomap from catkin_packages ``LIBRARIES`` entry (#2700 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/2700>)

  * Made setVerbose virtual in constraint_sampler so that child classes can override
  * Manipulability Index Error for few DOF
    When the group has fewer than 6 DOF, the Jacobian is of the form 6xM and when multiplied by its transpose, forms a 6x6 matrix that is singular and its determinant is always 0 (or NAN if the solver cannot calculate it).
    Since calculating the SVD of a Jacobian is a costly operation, I propose to retain the calculation of the Manipulability Index through the determinant for 6 or more DOF (where it produces the correct result), but use the product of the singular values of the Jacobian for fewer DOF.
  * Fixed missing test depends for tf_conversions
  * Allow setFromIK() with multiple poses to single IK solver
  * Improved debug output
  * Removed duplicate functionality poseToMsg function
  * New setToRandomPositions function with custom rand num generator

  * Fixed bug in RevoluteJointModel::distance() giving large negative numbers.
  * kinematics_base: added an optional RobotState for context.
  * fix pick/place approach/retreat on indigo/14.04
  * Fixed bug in RevoluteJointModel::distance() giving large negative numbers.
  * IterativeParabolicTimeParameterization now ignores virtual joints.
  * kinematics_base: added an optional RobotState for context.
  * Removed check for multi-dof joints in iterative_time_parameterization.cpp.
  * fix pick/place approach/retreat on indigo/14.04
  * IterativeParabolicTimeParameterization now ignores virtual joints.
    When checking if all joints are single-DOF, it accepts multi-DOF joints only if they are
    also virtual.
  * Fix compiler warnings
  * Address [cppcheck: unreadVariable] warning.
  * Address [cppcheck: postfixOperator] warning.
  * Address [cppcheck: stlSize] warning.
  * Address [-Wunused-value] warning.
  * Address [-Wunused-variable] warning.

  * Address [-Wreorder] warning.
  * Allow joint model group to have use IK solvers with multiple tip frames
  * KinematicsBase support for multiple tip frames and IK requests with multiple poses
  * dynamics_solver: fix crashbug
    Ignore joint that does not exist (including the virtual joint if it is part of
    the group).
  * Changed KinematicsBase::supportsGroup() to use a more standard call signature.
  * Merged with hydro-devel
  * Removed unnecessary error output
  * Removed todo
  * Added support for legacy IK calls without solution_callback
  * Merge branch 'hydro-devel' into kinematic_base
  * Changed KinematicsBase::supportsGroup() to use a more standard call signature.
  * Added empty check.
  * computeCartesianPath waypoints double-up fix
    computeCartesianPath appends full trajectories between waypoints when given a vector of waypoints. As trajectories include their endpoints, this leads to the combined trajectory being generated with duplicate points at waypoints, which can lead to pauses or stuttering.
    This change skips the first point in trajectories generated between waypoints.
  * avoid unnecessary calculations
  * Created supportsGroup() test for IK solvers
  * from ros-planning/more-travis-tests
    More Travis test fixes.
  * Commented out failing test.
    run_tests_moveit_ros_perception requires glut library, and thus a video card or X server, but I haven't had any luck making such things work on Travis.
  * avoid unnecessary calculations
    If we are not going to use the missing vector then we should not create it
    (avoid an expensive operation).
  * Code cleanup
  * Allow joint model group to have use IK solvers with multiple tip frames
  * Authorship
  * Fixed missing removeSlash to setValues()
  * Feedback and cleaned up comment lengths
  * Cleaned up commit
  * KinematicsBase support for multiple tip frames and IK requests with multiple poses
