ros-melodic-moveit-experimental (0.10.0-0bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * Merge pull request #906 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/906> from ubi-agni/compile-fixes
    various fixes for melodic build
  * boost::shared_ptr to std::shared_ptr
  * MoveIt! tf2 migration (#830 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/830>)
    migration from tf to tf2 API, resolves issue #745 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/745>
    - All type conversions now depend on geometry2 ROS packages, rather than geometry
    (see https://github.com/ros/geometry2/pull/292 and
    https://github.com/ros/geometry2/pull/294 for details of the new conversions)
    - Removes all boost::shared_ptr<tf::TransformListener> from the API,
    and replaced them with std::shared_ptr<tf2_ros::Buffer>'s
    - Utilize new tf2 API in the tf::Transformer library to access the internal tf2::Buffer of RViz
    (see https://github.com/ros/geometry/pull/163 for details of the new API)
    - Removes prepending of forward slashes ('/') for transforms frames as this is deprecated in tf2
    - Replaced deprecated tf2 _getLatestCommonTime
  * update include statements to use new pluginlib and class_loader headers (#827 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/827>)
  * fix printf conversion specifiers for logging  (#876 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/876>)
    * printf size_t values with %zu
  * [Fix] switch to ROS_LOGGER from CONSOLE_BRIDGE (#874 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/874>)
    * [Fix] switch to ROS_LOGGER from CONSOLE_BRIDGE
    * [Fix] clang format
    * [Fix] manually fix bad clang-formatting in strings
  * Merge pull request #863 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/863> from ubi-agni/fix-buid-farm-issues
    * fix various cmake warnings
    * remove not required test dependency
    * replaced 2nd find_package(catkin ...)
  * fix various cmake warnings
  * Add ability to request detailed distance information from fcl (#662 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/662>)
    Expose the ability to request detailed distance information from FCL. New virtual methods distanceXXX(DistanceRequest&, DistanceResult&) are provided in CollisionRobot and CollisionWorld. Existing methods were adapted to use the new underlying infrastructure of DistanceRequests.

ros-melodic-moveit-experimental (0.9.0-0bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * Replace broken Eigen3 with correctly spelled EIGEN3 (#254 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/254>)
    * Fix Eigen3 dependency throughout packages
    * Eigen 3.2 does not provide EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIRS, only EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR
  * fix exported plugin xml for collision_distance_field (#280 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/280>)
    Otherwise the xml can not be found on an installed workspace
  * Cleanup readme (#258 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/258>)
  * Convert collision_distance_field to std::shared_ptr.
  * Use shared_ptr typedefs in collision_distance_field and chomp.
  * Use srdf::ModelPtr typedefs.
  * Switch to std::make_shared.
  * [moveit_experimental] Fix incorrect dependency on FCL in kinetic
    [moveit_experimental] Fix Eigen3 warning
  * Remove deprecated package shape_tools
    Fix OcTree boost::shared_ptr
    Remove deprecated CMake dependency
    Fix distanceRobot() API with verbose flags
  * Fix CHOMP planner and CollisionDistanceField (#155 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/155>)
    * Copy collision_distance_field package
    * Resurrect chomp
    * remove some old Makefiles and manifests
    * Correct various errors
    * Code formatting, author, description, version, etc
    * Add definitions for c++11. Nested templates problem.
    * Add name to planner plugin.
    * Change getJointModels to getActiveJointModels.
    * Call robot_state::RobotState::update in setRobotStateFromPoint.
    * Create README.md
    * Improve package.xml, CMake config and other changes suggested by jrgnicho.
    * Remove some commented code, add scaling factors to computeTimeStampes
    * Add install targets in moveit_experimental and chomp
    * Add install target for headers in chomp pkgs.
    * Remove unnecessary debugging ROS_INFO.
    * Port collision_distance_field test to indigo.
    * Remove one assertion that makes collision_distance_field test to fail.
  * Use urdf::*SharedPtr instead of boost::shared_ptr
    urdfdom_headers uses C++ std::shared_ptr. As it exports it as custom
    *SharedPtr type, we can use them to stay compatible.
    Note that there is no std:shared_ptr<const urdf::ModelInterface>
    typedef, so I replaced it with urdf::ModelInterfaceSharedPtr (loosing a
    const).
    Also, there is no conversion from boost::shared_ptr<urdf::Model> to
    std:shared_ptr<urdf::ModelInterface>, so I used a preprocessor
    directive.
  * fetch moveit_resources path at compile time
    using variable MOVEIT_TEST_RESOURCES_DIR provided by config.h
    instead of calling ros::package::getPath()
  * adapted paths to moveit_resources
    (renamed folder moveit_resources/test to moveit_resources/pr2_description)
