ros-melodic-moveit-kinematics (0.10.0-0stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Merge pull request #906 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/906> from ubi-agni/compile-fixes
    various fixes for melodic build
  * KDL solvers: provide dummy updateInternalDataStructures()
    ... for new abstract method in KDL 1.4.0 of Melodic
  * MoveIt! tf2 migration (#830 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/830>)
    migration from tf to tf2 API, resolves issue #745 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/745>
    - All type conversions now depend on geometry2 ROS packages, rather than geometry
    (see https://github.com/ros/geometry2/pull/292 and
    https://github.com/ros/geometry2/pull/294 for details of the new conversions)
    - Removes all boost::shared_ptr<tf::TransformListener> from the API,
    and replaced them with std::shared_ptr<tf2_ros::Buffer>'s
    - Utilize new tf2 API in the tf::Transformer library to access the internal tf2::Buffer of RViz
    (see https://github.com/ros/geometry/pull/163 for details of the new API)
    - Removes prepending of forward slashes ('/') for transforms frames as this is deprecated in tf2
    - Replaced deprecated tf2 _getLatestCommonTime
  * update include statements to use new pluginlib and class_loader headers (#827 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/827>)
  * [Fix] switch to ROS_LOGGER from CONSOLE_BRIDGE (#874 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/874>)
    * [Fix] switch to ROS_LOGGER from CONSOLE_BRIDGE
    * [Fix] clang format
    * [Fix] manually fix bad clang-formatting in strings
  * Merge pull request #863 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/863> from ubi-agni/fix-buid-farm-issues
    * fix various cmake warnings
    * remove not required test dependency
    * replaced 2nd find_package(catkin ...)
  * fix various cmake warnings
  * Improve ikfast kinematics plugin (#808 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/808>)
    * Initialize constant num_joints_ in constructor.
    * Check size of input array in getPositionFK.
    * Fix implementation error.
    * Add name variable to ikfast plugin.
  * Cached ik kinematics plugin (#612 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/612>)
    add caching wrapper for IK solvers
    * - Remove OMPL dependency, add slightly modified versions of OMPL code to this repo
    - Change camelCase variable names to underscore_names
    - Use /** ... */ for doxygen comments instead of /// ...
    - Fix memory leak
    - Various small fixes
    * handle optional TRAC-IK dependency a different way
    * remove OMPL_INCLUDE_DIRS
    * include trac_ik headers optionally *after* moveit includes
    Sorting dependency-includes via catkin breaks either way around
    with multiple find_package calls and can always break
    overlaying workspaces.
    However, ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS} contains many more dependencies
    than ${trac_ik_kinematics_plugin_INCLUDE_DIRS}, so avoid more
    breakage than necessary by including catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS first.
    * add missing include
    * Don't write configured file to build dir. Can't write to src dir either since it might be read-only. Instead, just comment out the parts that are for development / testing purposes only.
    * ik cache: use lookupParam for plugin parameters
